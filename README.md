 PROTOTYPE 1
 Similar map and camera to roll a ball. There is a goal on the ground (like MD) and there will be obstacles falling from the sky like (AP). Player will roll the ball in an enclosed plane and try to roll themselves to the goal (an area on the ground highlighted green). Each level (from MD) will be more difficult than the last by increasing the falling objects, more walls (like a maze), and holes in the ground. Possibly make at least/around 5 levels and each level will spawn an entirely new plane. Inspired by the idea to create a game implementing elements from all the games.
